DESCRIPTION
Most insert mode completions complete only the current word (or an entire
line), so one has to repeat i_CTRL-X_CTRL-N to complete the following words.
For longer completions, this is slow, especially because you sometimes have to
choose from multiple choices.
The completion provided by this plugin assumes that you know a Vim motion
(e.g. '3e', ')' or '/bar/e') or text object which covers the text you want
completed. When you invoke the completion, the completion base (some text
before the cursor, or the currently selected text) will be presented and the
motion to cover the completion text (including the completion base) will be
queried. Then, the list of completion candidates will be prepared and selected
in the usual way.

- Check out the CompleteHelper.vim plugin page (vimscript #3914) for a full
  list of insert mode completions powered by it.

USAGE
In insert mode, invoke the completion via CTRL-X CTRL-M.

This completion method is probably only used for longer matches, as
invoking this completion method with the querying of the {motion} isn't
very fast. For motions that cover many words or entire sentences, an empty
base isn't helpful, there would be far too many matches. To ensure a
completion base, this completion includes more than the usual keyword
characters directly before the cursor. It looks for the following before the
cursor, possibly with whitespace between it and the cursor:
- keyword character(s), e.g "foo" in "return (foo|"
- non-keyword non-whitespace character(s), e.g. "/*" in "return 0; /* |"
- keyword character(s) followed by non-keyword non-whitespace characters,
  e.g. "foo(" in "return foo(|"
When the completion base starts with a keyword character, matches must start
at a \<word border.
Alternatively, you can pre-select the base (via select or visual mode) before
invoking the completion. This ensures that the best context for completion is
chosen.

Input the {motion}.
You can then search forward and backward via CTRL-N / CTRL-P, as usual.

CTRL-X CTRL-M           The completion first queries for {motion} (press
                        <Enter> to conclude), then finds matches starting with
                        the MotionComplete-base text before the cursor,
                        covering {motion}.

{Visual}CTRL-X CTRL-M   The completion first queries for {motion} (press
                        <Enter> to conclude), then finds matches starting with
                        the selected text, covering {motion}.
                        Use this to define the completion base text (quickly
                        done from insert mode via [CTRL-]SHIFT-<Left>) for
                        better matches.
